## Dataset Summary
LIAR is a dataset for fake news detection with 12.8K human labeled short statements from politifact.com's API, and each statement is evaluated by a politifact.com editor for its truthfulness. The distribution of labels in the LIAR dataset is relatively well-balanced: except for 1,050 pants-fire cases, the instances for all other labels range from 2,063 to 2,638. In each case, the labeler provides a lengthy analysis report to ground each judgment.
